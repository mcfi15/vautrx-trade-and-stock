					Dear Users,
				
				
					&amp;nbsp;
				
				
					We have recently received reports from several users about fraudulent activities where scammers are impersonating our official representatives. These fraudsters are sending suspicious messages with links to unknown sources, requesting sensitive information like phone numbers, passwords, or even urging users to transfer funds to unauthorized accounts. Please be cautious and always verify the authenticity of such messages.
				
				
					&amp;nbsp;
				
				
					We would like to remind all users to stay vigilant against scams circulating in the crypto space to prevent asset loss. Given the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions and the privacy of user data, once a transaction is made or account details are compromised, recovery of your assets may not be possible.
				
				
					&amp;nbsp;
				
				
					For any inquiries, please reach out to our customer support team.
				
				
					&amp;nbsp;
				
				
					Thank you for your continued trust and support!
Support Team
